No nationwide outrage.\nNo calls for justice.\n\nBut today, people are demanding Ranveer\u2019s arrest for an incest joke on a comedy show.\n\nSo let\u2019s get this straight:\nA politician normalizing rape? Silence.\n\nA comedian making an inappropriate joke? Immediate outrage.\n\nDon't think that I have sympathy for Ranveer, I have the issue with prioritization of problems.\n\nAs women, we are told to stay silent when we are molested by family members.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t ruin the family name.\u2019\n\n\u2018Who will marry you if this comes out?\u2019\n\n\u2018It happens in every house. Adjust.\u2019\n\nWe are expected to endure domestic abuse because:\n\n\u2018Shaadi mein compromise toh karna padta hai.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ghar ki baat ghar mein rakhni chahiye.\u2019\n\n\u2018Aurat hi ghar banati hai.\u2019\n\nBut when a joke is made, suddenly, morality awakens.\n\nSuddenly, people care about what is offensive and inappropriate.\nWhere was this outrage when:\n\nMarital rape is still not criminalized?\n\nDomestic violence cases are dismissed as 'ghar ka maamla'?\n\nWomen reporting harassment are shamed instead of believed?\n\nThis isn\u2019t about defending a joke. This is about society\u2019s hypocrisy - where outrage is selective, and power decides whose voice matters.\n\nIf we put even half the energy we do into canceling celebrities into holding real abusers accountable, maybe this country would be safer for women.\n\nBut no, it's easier to be offended by words than by the system that allows real violence to continue.\n\nIf words hurt you more than actions, maybe it\u2019s time to rethink what really needs to change.",
